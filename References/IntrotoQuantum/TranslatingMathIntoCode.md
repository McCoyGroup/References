# Translating Math Into Code

Coming Soon!

Here's the basic outline:

* We'll basically just put everything we learned together
* We'll break our larger mathematical problem into subproblems
* Each of those will have a mathematical form
* We'll parse those mathematical forms into their physical meaning
* Finally we'll set up the code to implement this meaning
