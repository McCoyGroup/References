# A Hierarchical View of Problem Solving

Coming Soon!

Here's the basic outline:

* We only deal with _straightforward_ problems in the kind of science we do
* These kinds of problems have a hierarchical structure
* We can treat the problem similar to following a map
* By having a pretty rigid overarching structure, but flexibility w.r.t to solving the smallest, most specific bits, we can make progress without getting trapped on one route 
* This problem solving structure maps directly onto code!
