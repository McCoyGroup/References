# Practical Quantum Mechanics

There are thousands of primers on quantum mechanics out there, so like why am I writing my own?
Well, if you ask me, those thousands of primers focus on the stuff that doesn't matter (even if it can be fun).
What does matter? I'd say impact.

There's no reason to do a bunch of work and calculate a bunch of things just because it's hard (sorry JFK). Instead, we'll want to work on things that matter.
