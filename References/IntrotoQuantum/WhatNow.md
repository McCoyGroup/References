# What Now?

That's a great question. 
At this point, it's mostly up to you to try your hand at new, interesting problems. 
The thought process we applied here will be applicable to things _outside_ of quantum chemistry, but in case you want _chemically relevant_ examples, we've made a collection of [Code Samples](CodeSamples) where we applied these techniques to specific problems.

Another really important thing is building up your _self-confidence_, which for me took the form of building up my coding skills. 
A good way to do that is just read, read, read, and then find something you're even somewhat passionate about, and just try to do it. 
My first "real" thing was making an app to tally inventory for my parents; I'm sure you can find something that'll get you going, too.

If you're looking for stuff to read, here are some (hopefully) useful resources:
* [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/): great for getting started with a new language and learning the basics
* [Object-Oriented Programming](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html): I linked the way the python documentation explains _classes_ which are one of the main ways this comes up--basically just a very, very useful design pattern that lets you build bigger and better
* [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/): the "language" which much web content is written in these days--if you ever find yourself asking stuff on Stack Overflow (or a private Stack Overflow Team) or making a site like this, it'll be really nice to know how to write Markdown + it's also well designed and straightforward.
* [Version Control](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners): Most of the world uses `git` for this, but basically just a way to make sure that you never lose work by accident with the added benefit of logging all of the great stuff you've done! Employers love to see active GitHub repos.
* [Programming Blogs](https://blog.codinghorror.com/): I waffled on whether to include this, since a lot of these bloggers are huge neckbeards that love themselves too much. On the other hand, it's really helpful to see how other people approached problems. On the other hand, despite having a literal neckbeard, Jeff Atwood is one of the better people about this. 
* So many other things!: I just listed the five things that I had off the top of my head. As you work on your own projects and things, I'm sure you'll find what works for you and that is what matters most.
