# Reading Math

This is the section where I'm hoping to convince you that the math we work with is really not so bad and that you can do it too.
So pls be convinced.
We're going to treat mathematical expressions the exact same way we treated our code, that is we'll say

> A math expression...
* Takes a set of inputs
* Applies a series of transformations to the data to return an output
* Tells a "story"

What's pretty convenient is these expressions are inherently hierarchical, so if we're given the expression
