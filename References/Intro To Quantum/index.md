# An Intro to Problem-Solving in Quantum Chemistry

Quantum chemistry, as an application of quantum mechanics, gets a bad rap for being "hard".
Simply put, it is a field where technical language has taken over and can be unwelcoming and overwhelming to those just dipping their toes in. 

For example, in standard converstaion, bringing up work in "quantum chemistry" evokes looks of horror, although it is usually a conversation ender if you need an out.  
On the other hand, even within chemistry, there's sometimes still a conception that "quantum" is tough, primarily based of these three simple facts:

1. It is **usually** the last discipline of chemistry covered (if at all) during a Bachelor's degree.
2. It is one of the most "mathematically involved" (Linear algebra? Who do you know here?)
3. We let the words carry too much power. 

So let's break down:

1. Ever heard of saving the best for last?
2. Yes, **integrals suck** and you need them, BUT _you (usually) don't need to do any integrals yourself_, since some mathematician somewhere did the relevant ones for you in 1840 and like why reinvent the wheel?
3. Not to get philosophical but "What's in a name? that which we call a rose; By any other name would smell as sweet..."

Our hope with this resource is to develop strategies to get around having to do integrals--and often derivatives-- (and some linear algebra) by breaking our problems down into bits and using _tricky tricks_ (a term coined by our very own, Mark Boyer).
This will of course require time and effort to get good at, after all you are embarking on a journey in a new language, but we hope to be a friendly travel guide and we don't expect any creative breakthroughs, strokes of genius, or aesthsically pleasing social media posts. (although these are sometimes helpful too.)

So for a quick roadmap:

1. [First](PracticalQuantumMechanics.md) we'll make sure everyone has a good basic understanding of the core problems we're gonna try to solve
2. [Next](AHierarchicalViewOfProblemSolving.md) we're going to look at how to take a problem and break it down into a hierarchy of smaller problems and translating these into code
3. [Third](ReadingAFunction.md) we'll take a breather to figure out how to figure out how _other people_ solved their problems by learning some tricks for reading code
4. [Then](ReadingMath.md) we'll take a stab at developing strategies for breaking a chunk of math into its component bits so that we can reuse ideas
5. [Finally](TranslatingMathIntoCode.md) we'll put this all together to find ways to translate math into code

And for a bonus round, you can head to [McCoy Group Code Academy]() for practical applications of these problems!

Finally, if this isn't your path that's cool too. There are tons of great resources out there, track some down that work for you. 
And if you're feeling generous, come back and drop some [feedback]() (It wasn't the Romeo and Juliet was it?)
