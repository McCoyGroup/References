# An Intro to Problem-Solving in Quantum Chemistry

Quantum chemistry, as an application of quantum mechanics, gets a bad rap for being "hard".
If you mention to non-chemists that you do "quantum", usually they look at you askance since they've either only heard the term in bad sci-fi technobabble or from the mouth of some pretentious physicist who thinks they're God's gift to knowledge.
On the other hand, even within chemistry, there's sometimes still a conception that "quantum" is tough, born of one basic fact:
**integrals suck**. 
And basically to "do quantum" you need do integrals, which most people see in intro calculus and then hope to never see again.

Here's the secret, though, _you (usually) don't need to do any integrals yourself_, since some mathematician somewhere did the relevant ones for you in 1840 and like why reinvent the wheel?

Instead, what we'll do is develop strategies to get around having to do integrals--and often derivatives--by breaking our problems down into bits and using tricky tricks.
This will of course require time and effort to get good at, but no more effort than learning to write a good non-science paper (and usually considerably less) and we don't need any creative breakthroughs or strokes of genius, although those can be super helpful too.

Here's the way we'll go about this:

1. [First](PracticalQuantumMechanics.md) we'll make sure everyone has a good basic understanding of the core problems we're gonna try to solve
2. [Next](AHierarchicalViewOfProblemSolving.md) we're going to look at how to take a problem and break it down into a hierarchy of smaller problems and translating these into code
3. [Third](ReadingAFunction.md) we'll take a breather to figure out how to figure out how _other people_ solved their problems by learning some tricks for reading code
4. [Then](ReadingMath.md) we'll take a stab at developing strategies for breaking a chunk of math into its component bits so that we can reuse ideas
5. [Finally](TranslatingMathIntoCode.md) we'll put this all together to find ways to translate math into code

And if you don't like this game plan, that's cool too. There are tons of great resources out there, so track some down. 
No need to follow mine, but if you do I will be eternally grateful for feedback ;_;
