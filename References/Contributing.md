# Contributing

Our goal is to make contributing to this site as easy as possible.
First off, you'll probably want to look at our [primary page](../Contributing.md) explaining how to contribute.

The next thing to keep in mind is that we're writing for a ~1st year graduate student. 
What this means in terms of programming & math background is pretty variable, so be kind to your readers. 
There's no need to baby them, but keep the language supportive.

Visuals never hurt, either, and you should almost always have at least some kind of example on your pages.

Each of the three main topic areas we currently have has a list of references. 
Proof-reading would be great. 
Comments and places for improvement would _also_ be great.
Our [issues](https://github.com/McCoyGroup/References/issues) page is a good place to leave comments & you can even tag a specific grad student as the person who should look into the topic (if you know who to tag).

And if you run into a blank page, but think you can write the reference, write it! Then obviously let other people know so they can proof-read what you wrote, too. No one has perfect first drafts.
