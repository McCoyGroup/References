# Discrete Variable Representation Spectra

Needs to be filled out:
* DVR can be treated as a special case of a basis set approach
* When doing that, we can just take advantage of the fact that that our DVR basis gives _discrete_ representations
* For performance (if we want to) this can be replaced with a dot product
* Important to note that you have to evaluate the operator at the DVR points, not the other way around
* Fun aside: basically just a trapezoid-rule approximation of the integral
