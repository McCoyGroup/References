# Basis Set Methods

One of the oldest approaches to solving the Schr√∂dinger equation, basis set methods (sometimes called matrix methods) are based in linear algebra. If you're unfamiliar with linear algebra, this can sound a little bit scary. As you build up your familiarity, though, you'll come to find that there's no branch of "advanced" math that's kinder to us.[<sup>1</sup>]

1. <a id="fn1"></a> I'm not lying when I say this. Linear algebra is basically taking regular `y = m*x + b`-type algebra and making it work when we have more variables than just `x`. This means that 90% of what you need to learn is rooted in stuff you probably learned in Middle school.
