# The Particle on a Ring Basis

The particle on the ring (POR) basis is useful for studying internal rotations and torsions within a molecule.
It gives the solutions to the Schr√∂dinger equation for the Hamiltonian

$$
H = -\frac{1}{2 I} \frac{d^2}{d \tau^2}
$$

where $I = m R^2$ is the moment of inertia for a particle of mass $m$ on a ring of radius $R$ and $\tau$ is the rotation angle.

To be valid wavefunctions, the POR basis must be _periodic_ and hence is relevant for periodic problems on the domain $[0, 2 \pi]$

### Properties of the Basis

The wavefunctions are given by

$$
\phi_k(\tau) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2\pi}} e^{(i k \tau)}
$$

where $k$ is any integer and has the range of 0 to the expansion order of the Fourier function.

This leads to a few key properties[<sup>1</sup>]. Assuming that $n<m$

$$
|m\rangle|n\rangle = |n+m\rangle \\
\langle n|\frac{d^2}{d x^2}|m\rangle = -k^2 \delta_{n,m} \\
\langle n|\cos(k \tau)|m\rangle = \begin{cases}
  1 &  k=m+n \\
  1 & -k=m+n \\
  0 &  \text{else}
\end{cases} \\
\langle n|\sin(k \tau)|m\rangle = \begin{cases}
  1 &  k=n+m \\
 -1 & -k=n+m \\
  0 &  \text{else}
\end{cases}
$$

where $n$ and $m$ represent the Particle on a Ring basis states. This means that the range of $n$ and $m$ varies with the number of basis functions you choose to use or the _Basis Size_. Ultimately, the range spans from -_Basis Size_ to _Basis Size_ including 0. One last thing to note at this point, the Basis Size at it's smallest would be equal to the expansion order or $k$, but in order to get _stable_ solutions to the Hamiltionian (not changing numerically by increasing the basis size), the basis size will become larger than the value of $k$, but these properties greatly simplify increasing the size of the basis. Do you see why?

### Hamiltonian Forms

Any function that can be fit to a form like

$$
F(\tau) = \sum_{k} c_k cos(k \tau) + s_k sin(k \tau)
$$

will have a simple representation in this basis. The technical name for this form is a _Fourier series_, so in the applications that follow we'll talk about using a Fourier expansion for our operators.

A common form of Hamiltonian that this is good for is something like

$$
\hat{H} = -\frac{1}{2 I} \frac{d^2}{d \tau^2} + \sum_{k} c_k cos(k \tau)
$$

which is just a particle on a ring with an added potential term.

For things like torsions, the effective moment of inertia is generally a function of $\tau$. If that's the case, a kinetic energy like

$$
 \hat{T} = \frac{1}{2}\left( p_\tau^2B(\tau) +B(\tau) p_\tau^2 +\frac{d^2}{d\tau^2}B(\tau) \right)
$$

is more appropriate.

For the purposes of this discussion, $B$ represents an effective rotation constant. We also treat $B$ through a Fourier expansion as

$$
B(\tau) = \sum_k b_k \cos(k \tau)
$$

So in the frame of this discussion we are looking at a total Hamiltonian of the form 

$$
H = \frac{1}{2}\left [p_\tau^2B(\tau) +B(\tau) p_\tau^2 +\frac{d^2B(\tau)}{d\tau^2}\right ] + V(\tau)
$$

Looking at the matrix elements, we know 

$$
\langle n|\exp\left (im\tau\right )|m = \delta_{|m-n|-k}
$$
    
so using this Hamiltonian form we can rewrite as follows
    
$$
        \left\langle n|H|m\right\rangle &=& \left \{b_0\left(m^2\right )+v_0\right \}\delta_{m,n}\nonumber + \sum_{k=1}  \left\{ \left [\left (n\right )^2 +m^2-k^2\right ]\frac {b_k}{4}+\frac{v_k}{2}\right \}\delta_{|m-n|-k,0}
$$

A final note, circling back to the properties of the basis, we know that once $|m-n| > k$ the matrix element is 0. Keep this in mind as you are thinking of ways to write and _optimize_ your python implementation of the Particle on a Ring Basis Set Representation.

2. How to set up and solve for eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the above described Hamiltonian starting with coefficents of $B$ and $V$ as they are expanded in a Fourier series. 
3. How to use the eigenvalues and eigevectors of this representation to evaluate and plot the Particle on a Ring wavefunctions.
