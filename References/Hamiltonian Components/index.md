# Hamiltonian Components

We like to write the Hamiltonian as

$$
H = T + V
$$

because it's clean, simple, and general.
Unfortunately, we usually need a specific form for $T$ or $V$ to do a calculation.
This section details various components and forms of $T$ and $V$ and how to calculate them.

* [Rotational Contstants](RotationalConstants.md)
* [The G-Matrix](GMatrix.md)
* [`V'`, the "psuedopotential"](Pseudopotential.md)
* [Reaction Path Normal Modes](ReactionPath.md)
**(In Progress)**
* [Coriolis Coupling](CoriolisCoupling.md)
