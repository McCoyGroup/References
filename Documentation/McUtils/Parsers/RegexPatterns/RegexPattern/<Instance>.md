Represents a combinator structure for building more complex regexes

    It might be worth working with this combinator structure in a _lazy_ fashion so that we can drill down
    into the expression structure... that way we can define a sort-of Regex calculus that we can use to build up higher
    order regexes but still be able to recursively inspect subparts?
