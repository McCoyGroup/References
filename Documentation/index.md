# Documentation

This is (partial) documentation for the McCoy group packages.
The listing here is automatically generated by our [Peeves](https://github.com/McCoyGroup/Peeves) unit-testing/documentation building package.

Each page _should_ support examples, but unfortunately most do not, simply because writing that kind of thing by hand is time consuming.
If you see a page without examples, help us out!
Even though these pages are automatically generated, you can add examples to them by putting a file in the appropriate _examples_ slot and rebuilding the docs via the `docs.py` script we've provided.
At some point that will become part of a CI process, but we're unfortunately not there yet. 
If you want to just let us know that you added some examples so we can trigger a build, that can be done via the [issues](https://github.com/McCoyGroup/References/issues/new?title=Documentation%20Build%20Needed) page.
Similarly, if you see something that you think should be improved, you can either edit the docstrings in the source or let us know about the deficiency [here]([issues](https://github.com/McCoyGroup/References/issues/new?title=Documentation%20Improvement%20Needed)).

To contribute an example for a page at 

```
https://mccoygroup.github.io/References/Documentation/McUtils/GaussianInterface.html
```

you'll either add the appropriate file by going to 

```
https://github.com/McCoyGroup/References/new/gh-pages/Documentation/examples/McUtils/GaussianInterface.md
```

or edit the existing one by going to 

```
https://github.com/McCoyGroup/References/edit/gh-pages/Documentation/examples/McUtils/GaussianInterface.md
```

We have documentation for these packages:

  - [McUtils](McUtils.md)
  - [Psience](Psience.md)
  - [Peeves](Peeves.md)
  - [RynLib](RynLib.md)
