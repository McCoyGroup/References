"""
Goal: The goal of this exercise is to write an implementation of continuous weighting diffusion Monte Carlo.
This guide contains three different options for evaluating the potential. It's not neccessary to write them all out
immediately, but always good to lay out your options. Note: It's easiest if this is done in ATOMIC UNITS.

This also introduces a very basic way to get your simulation into a class based format instead of just a bunch of
functions. If this is confusing at all please reach out with questions and the rest of the group will definitely
answer.
