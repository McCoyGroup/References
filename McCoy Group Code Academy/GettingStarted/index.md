# Getting Started

## Introduction
With that being said, the goal of **McCode Academy** (and this whole website honestly) is to get people comfortable with the ways that math, code, and chemical intuition intersect. In order to do that, we (the McCoy Group circa 2020) are documenting some of the most important things and most common stumbling blocks we found while getting started ourselves. We hope that in this way, we can help you avoid some headaches and feel more confident diving into your first research project. 

Through these pages, we have attempted to *hit the highlights* and lay a nice ground work for using Python in a quantum chemistry setting. You will find lists of helpful functions, common issues we've faced (and solutions to them), and some guiding exercises for applying these tools. We recommend using an _Integrated Development Environment_ or IDE like our favorite [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), as you work through and practice these skills. (Check out the [Find Helpful Tools](UsefulTools.md) page for more information on PyCharm!) 

## Choose your own adventure
Start by walking through Code Structures: 
* [Your "First" Python Script](FirstPythonScript.md)
* [How to Write a Function](HowToWriteAFunction.md)
* [From Functions to Classes](FunctionsToClasses.md)

or by looking at how to: 
* [Find Helpful Tools](UsefulTools.md) 
* [Avoid Common Issues](CommonIssues.md).
