# Getting Started

We're hopeful that this can be an effective resource for getting people up to speed and decreasing the anxiety/stress/feelings of inadequacy that often come with starting with coding/quantum chemistry.
To make that transition as smooth as possible, we're documenting some of the most important things/most common stumbling blocks when getting started.

* [Introduction](intro.md)
* [Your First Python Script](FirstPythonScript.md)
* [To Functions and Beyond](FunctionsAndBeyond.md)

We've also collected some resource for you to help you [find helpful tools](UsefulTools.md) and [avoid common issues](CommonIssues.md).
