# An Introduction to Python

Why learn Python? ...

**A quick aside:** If you start googling around, one of the first things you'll figure out about python is that there are two main versions of it. There's python2, which first came out in 2000, and python3 which came out in 2008.
Migration to python3 has been [incredibly slow](https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/11/14/why-is-the-migration-to-python-3-taking-so-long/), so you'll probably see stuff talking about python2 when you try to look stuff up on the internet.
Despite that, we really want to be using python3. The features are worth it, and python2 is no longer supported.

## What is Anaconda?

Add a note or two..

## How do I download them?
Here we like to use Anaconda. It is a bit more streamlined and is the same way python is installed on the group computers as well as any _High Performace Computing_ (HPC) clusters (like mox or NERSC) you may encounter. If you already have Anaconda from using jupityer or something of the sort, you are off to a good start.

### Installing Anaconda 3

Fill in :) 

### Installing Python 3

First we'll go to the [Python Organization downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download whichever version they're saying is the latest (as of writing this that's currently 3.8).
That should download an installer and we'll just do what the python.org people tell us to do to get it installed.
