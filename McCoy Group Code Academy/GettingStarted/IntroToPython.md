# An Introduction to Python

Python is a _programming language_, which is to say, it's a way to write down instructions for computers to do things so we don't have to.
There are tons of programming languages out there and as you get more and more comfortable with programming, you'll undoubtedly find yourself working with more than one of them.
The fact that there are so many languages out there also means that we should probably justify why we opt to use python over any of the other choices, and there are a few big reasons:
1. Python is nice: it works hard to hide unnecessary details about how computers work (people often say it's a _high-level language_)
2. Python is flexible: It's not the fastest language, but it can do just about anything. As scientists, we generally need flexibility more than speed.
3. Python is popular: As opposed to something like [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/language/elementary-introduction/2nd-ed/01-starting-out-elementary-arithmetic.html), another nice, flexible language, Python has a huge user base, which means most python questions can be resolved just with a bit of googling.

**Important Note:** If you start googling around, one of the first things you'll figure out about python is that there are two main versions of it. There's python2, which first came out in 2000, and python3 which came out in 2008.
Migration to python3 has been [incredibly slow](https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/11/14/why-is-the-migration-to-python-3-taking-so-long/), so you'll probably see stuff talking about python2 when you try to look stuff up on the internet.
Despite that, we really want to be using python3. The features are worth it, and python2 is no longer supported.

## What is Anaconda?

Unlike a regular application, e.g. Slack, Python can be distributed

## How do I download them?
Here we like to use Anaconda.
It is a bit more streamlined and is the same way python is installed on the group computers as well as any _High Performace Computing_ (HPC) clusters (like mox or NERSC) you may encounter.
 If you already have Anaconda from using Jupyter or something of the sort, you are off to a good start.

### Installing Anaconda 3

Fill in :) 

### Installing Python 3

First we'll go to the [Python Organization downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download whichever version they're saying is the latest (as of writing this that's currently 3.8).
That should download an installer and we'll just do what the python.org people tell us to do to get it installed.
