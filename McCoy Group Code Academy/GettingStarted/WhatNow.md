# What Now?

At this point, the best thing to do is practice. Reading this tutorial is good. Reading related tutorials is also good.
But those alone are unfortunately not enough to really get you to where you'll want to be for doing science.

To help you out with this we've set up a bunch of [exercises](../Exercises) that will hopefully give you a flavor for what we do.
And as you work through those, come back to this material and check out the [other McCode Academy sections](..).

Got anything you'd like to add to this? Feel free. [We welcome contributions](../Contributing.md).

Otherwise good luck & don't forget to have fun.
