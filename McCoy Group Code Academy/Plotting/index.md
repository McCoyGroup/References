# Plotting

Coming Soon! Hereâ€™s the outline:

* Good presentation of data is just as important as good data
* There are lots of tools out there for plotting
* Python has a standard plotting library called `matplotlib`. It's got some warts, but since it's such a standard it's probably gonna be the easiest thing to use. We'll show some of the basics.
* `pyplot` vs. `figure` & `Axes`: a dialog
* Tips for how to learn about how to use `matplotlib` on your own
* A discussion of plotting best practices (e.g. make sure plots can be directly compared, have axes labels, etc.) and how to make your code force you to use them
