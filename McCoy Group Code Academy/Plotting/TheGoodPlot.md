# Principles of Good Plotting

It's hard, exactly, to say what makes a plot "good" and we're definitely not the people to go to with your deep questions on the subject.
We are not visual designers, and we have no particular expertise in data presentation.
On the other hand, we have seen a lot of _bad_ plots and so here are our recommendations, with examples.

1. When comparing two things, unless wholly infeasible, make sure the plots have the same axes ranges
2. Lines should be in bold colors that are visually distinguishable to people with color-blindness
3. Plots should remain mostly comprehensible in black and white
4. Plot labels should use sans-serif fonts
5. The plot range and aspect ratio should be chosen so as to not distort the data.


### Examples

TBD<br/>
I think we never want to show _bad_ examples. It's better to just positively reinforce what we think ought to be done.
Feel free to change the "Principles" I laid out. They were just what came off the top of my head.
