# Programming Tips

The majority of the work we do is really engineering, not science.
We spend many more hours writing code to get and analyze our data than sitting down with the data itself, which isn't to say that we don't spend a lot of time with our data, simply that that the coding aspect is unfortunately more time consuming.
And really, this is why we set up this tutorial in the first place. If the code were easy, why would we have a McCode Academy?

When one is already spending so much time just getting things to work, it can be hard to commit to doing more work to improve the quality of one's code, too.
We'd like to throw in our two cents on this, both encouraging you to put in that extra effort and also give you some tips so that writing good code is easier.

Since you are curious about good programming practice, aside from our opinion, we also want to point out the many opinions the Molecular Sciences Software Institute has regarding good Software Development Structure through [Object-Oriented Programming](http://education.molssi.org/oop_and_design_patterns/01-Object-Oriented_Programming/index.html), [Code Style](https://education.molssi.org/python-package-best-practices/04-function-style/index.html) , [Git](https://education.molssi.org/python-package-best-practices/02-git/index.html) and [Github](https://education.molssi.org/python-package-best-practices/03-github/index.html), [Testing](https://education.molssi.org/python-package-best-practices/07-testing/index.html),  (http://education.molssi.org/python_scripting_cms/index.html), and Extensibility and Maintainability through software [Design Patterns](http://education.molssi.org/oop_and_design_patterns/)) 

Here's the road map:

* [Writing for Someone Else](OtherCentricDesign.md)
* [Writing for the Future](FutureCentricDesign.md)
* [Code Style](DevelopingCodeStyle.md)
* [Further Reading](FurtherReading.md)
