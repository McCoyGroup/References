# Programming Tips

Coming Soon! Hereâ€™s the outline:

* It really is worth writing good code
* A good trick is to always write as if someone else will need to use your code. When doing so, keep in mind reading code is fundamentally a hard thing to do. Finding ways to make the logic of your program clearer will always be beneficial.
* Over the years programmers have found ways to reduce the mental strain of programming and it's worth learning from those. A big one is the object-oriented programming style, which basically allows you to write code in terms of relationships between objects and concepts.
* If you need to speed up your code, there are also many ways to do that, most of which are done by being clever about how we do stuff in NumPy and doing less work with arrays.
