# Further Reading

We're just a bunch of scientists with some strong opinions and the desire to make the lives of the next generation of grad students a little bit better.
So not only do we not have the time to put all the important programming best practices down here, but we also don't even know them in the first place.
That means it's incumbent upon you to keep on reading and learning, and passing on your knowledge to the next batch of students. 
To get you started on that, though, we've accumulated a short list of places that we think might be good to start:

* [Martijn Peter's StackOverflow Answers](https://stackoverflow.com/users/100297/martijn-pieters)
* [MolSSI Best Practices](https://molssi.org/education/best-practices/)
* [Google's Exercises for Python](https://developers.google.com/edu/python)
