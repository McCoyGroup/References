# Data & Input/Output

Coming Soon! Here's the outline:

* What is I/O?
* We can't do anything without data
* Sometimes you can copy-paste but this quickly becomes cumbersome
* With huge data there's no way you can copy paste
* Some formats for storing data are better than others
* Some formats are _de facto_ standards and generally using one of these is good
* Standardization of storage formats across the group would increase code reusability
* How do I parse a large data file?
* How do I write a data file?
* What formats are most relevant for us?
