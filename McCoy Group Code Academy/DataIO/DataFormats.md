# Different Data Formats

> Coming Soon! Here's the outline:
* There's a big difference between formats that are _human readable_ and ones that are _machine readable_
* The latter are more useful than the former
* Some formats are _de facto_ standards and generally using one of these is good
* Developing an internal standard for storing molecule and wavefunction data would help increase code reusability
