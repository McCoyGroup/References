As of now (2022), [Mox](https://wiki.cac.washington.edu/display/hyakusers/Hyak+mox+Overview) is the main super computer at UW. To use it you first need to be approved to use it, which is managed by the Research Computing Club, and you can read more about getting started with them [here](https://depts.washington.edu/uwrcc/getting-started-2/getting-started/). The big thing is that you have to do a small quiz and email the person at the RCC who manages the approved user list. It's a low-stakes, low-stress thing.

You'll also need to enable Hyak & Lolo on the Computing Services tab of your [UW NetID management thing](https://uwnetid.washington.edu/manage/?service).

After you're approved, there are many things you can do and a long, detailed Wiki can be found [here](https://wiki.cac.washington.edu/display/hyakusers/WIKI+for+Hyak+users), but to hit a cuple of the highlights.

#### Once you get onto Mox, you'll want to also:
* Get added to the `chem` queue
    - send an email to the member manager (ask someone for help figuring out who it is)
* Get added to the `ilahie` queue
    - send an email to the member manager (ask someone for help figuring out who it is)
* Get permission to use Gaussian on Mox
    - send an email to Xiaosong or one of his students (probably double check who..)
