### Supercomputing at UW
As a UW Student you have acess to _supercomputers_! As a member of the McCoy Group you have opportunities to access even more _supercomputers_!! 

### UW Supercomputer - Hyak
As of right now, we use the [Mox](https://wiki.cac.washington.edu/display/hyakusers/Hyak+mox+Overview) and [Klone](https://wiki.cac.washington.edu/display/hyakusers/WIKI+for+Hyak+users#WIKIforHyakusers-HyakOverview) clusters of Hyak, however Mox is being phased out and most people are migrating to Klone. On both clusters there are the `stf` queue is (You have access by being a student), `chem` queue (nodes managed by the chemistry department), only on Mox there is `ilahie` queue (more nodes you can get access to), and only on Klone there `mccoy` queue (which you can only get access to if you are in the McCoy group).

* Read more about getting started with and using Hyak [here](hyak.md)!
  
### Other Supercomputers
We sometimes also use supercomputers off the UW campus like: 
* [NERSC](nersc.md)

### Already Supercomputing? 
* Read up on [_High Performace Computing_ (HPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing) and [_Message Passing Interface_ (MPI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface), and then learn about how we implement them [here](HPC_MPI.md)!
