### Supercomputing at UW
As a UW Student you have acess to _supercomputers_ ! As a member of the McCoy Group you have opportunities to access even more _supercomputers_ !!

### UW Supercomputer - Hyak
As of right now, we use the [Mox](https://wiki.cac.washington.edu/display/hyakusers/Hyak+mox+Overview) partition of Hyak. This is where the `stf` queue is (You have access by being a student), `chem` queue (nodes managed by the chemistry department), `ilahie` queue (more nodes you can get access to).

Read more about getting started with and using Mox [here](hyak.md)!

### McCoy Group Nodes on Klone
(Someone please write a sentence or two introducing this here)

Read more about getting started with and using the McCoy Group Nodes [here](kloneNodes.md)!

### Other Supercomputers
We sometimes also use supercomputers off the UW campus like: 
* [NERSC](nersc.md)

### Already Supercomputing? 
Read up on [_High Performace Computing_ (HPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing) and [_Message Passing Interface_ (MPI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface), and then learn about how we implement them [here](HPC_MPI.md)!
