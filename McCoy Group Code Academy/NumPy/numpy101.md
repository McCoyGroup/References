# Numpy 101

NumPy, at its heart, fixes the fact that python isn't good at managing big blocks of numbers.
To do this, NumPy introduces a core type called an `array`.
We can think of this as an _n_-dimensional matrix.
It can be a 1D matrix (a vector), a 2D matrix (just a regular matrix), a 3D matrix (a vector of 2D matrices), etc.
These _n_-D matrices are usually called _tensors_, so be ready to see that terminology in guides and tutorial outside of this.

We're not going to try to cover everything NumPy and arrays can do, but we want to hit the highlights
