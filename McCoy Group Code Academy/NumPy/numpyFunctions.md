# Listing of Helpful Numpy Functions

This is a listing of functions in [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/)/[scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) that members of the group have found particularly useful.
The idea isn't to be a complete listing nor to provide detailed documentation.
Rather we're hoping that this will serve as a jumping off point for you to investigate for yourself
and keep you from feeling like you're drowning in the docs.

## Making Arrays
* [zeros](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.zeros.html): creates a new array full of the value `0`
* [ones](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ones.html): creates a new array full of the value `1`
* [eye](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.eye.html): creates an identity matrix of whatever size you need

## Linear Algebra

* [norm](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.norm.html): gets the norm of a vector
* [eigh](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.eigh.html): computes the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a Hermitian matrix

### Adding to the List

If you want to add to the list, feel free.
All we're gonna ask is that you follow a basic template.
First decide which of the existing headings your function should go under, then add your function using Markdown like
```lang-none
* [<name of function>](<URL of documentation page>): brief description of what it does
```

At this point in time, that's all we're asking, but the hope is that it'll keep entropy at bay.
