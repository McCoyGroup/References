# Contributing

Our goal is to make contributing to McCode Academy as easy as possible.
First off, you'll probably want to look at our [primary page](../Contributing.md) explaining how to contribute.

The next thing to keep in mind is that we're writing for a ~1st year graduate student. 
What this means in terms of programming & math background is pretty variable, so be kind to your readers. 
There's no need to baby them, but keep the language supportive.

Visuals never hurt, either, and you should almost always have at least some kind of example on your pages.

### Topic Areas in Need of Help

Here's where we're in need of contributions:

* [NumPy](NumPy): we need usage examples
* [Plotting](Plotting): we need more introductory work as well as _good practice_ suggestions

... (please edit this list)

### Help with Proof-Reading

Most of these pages are at version `0.0.1` & and help with proof-reading would be great.
Feel free to edit anywhere you think things are unclear, incorrect, or just where the language isn't what we want it to be.
Comments and places for improvement would _also_ be great.
Our [issues](https://github.com/McCoyGroup/References/issues) page is a good place to leave comments & you can even tag a specific grad student as the person who should look into the topic (if you know who to tag).
