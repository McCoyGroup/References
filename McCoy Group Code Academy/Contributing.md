# Contributing

If you'd like to contribute, first off, thanks!

Secondly, we're running everything through GitHub Pages, so you can edit all the content on GitHub itself.
Even this page can be edited using the link at the bottom at the page.

New pages can be made using GitHub's built-in Add File mechanism, and files can be uploaded using the Upload File button.

We'll have more details on how everything should be set up as we work through it.
For now, feel free to reach out to any of the group members for info.

If you have questions, you can also always ask them on the [McCoy Group Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/c/mccoygroup/questions/ask).
