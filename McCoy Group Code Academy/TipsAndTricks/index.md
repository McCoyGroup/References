# Tips and Tricks

We have no hope of getting every single tip/trick down here that we use.
On the other hand, hopefully we can get the big ones down.
There's a lot of information out there, and part of the challenge of grad school is figuring out how to work with it all. 
With luck these sections will make things a bit better for you than we had it.

There's no particular ordering to these, but here they are, in order, anyway

* [Useful Tools](UsefulTools.md)
* [Common Issues](CommonIssues.md)
* [Math Tips](MathematicalProgramming.md)
