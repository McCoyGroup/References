# Welcome to McCoy Group Code Academy!

We hope that this is a nice stepping stone between learning python and jumping into research! Working through these samples will introduce you to (what we have deemed) helpful functions and _tricky tricks_ for the problems we work on in the group. 

## Getting Started: 
* Introduction

## Numpy:
* Numpy 101
* List of Helpful Numpy Functions

## Matplotlib:
* Matplotlib 101
* List of Helpful Matplotlib Functions

## Scipy:
* Interpolaing 101
* List of Helpful Scipy Functions

## Data parsing (os):
* What is I/O?
* How do I parse a large data file?
* How do I write a data file?

## Code Structure:
* Functions
* Scripts
* Classes
* How do I make my code faster?

## Exercises
* Expand a Function as a Fourier Series
* Apply a change of basis to a Hamiltonian
* Colbert-Miller 1D DVR
* Colbert-Miller Multidimensional DVR
* Calculate Adiabatic Potentials
* Calculate Franck-Condon Transition Intensities
* Calculate Intenisties with a Linear Dipole
* Anderson DMC
