PyVibDMC is a general purpose package for running diffusion Monte Carlo jobs. It has a lot of flexibility and is very well documented [here](https://pyvibdmc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). You can either download it off [GitHub](https://github.com/rjdirisio/pyvibdmc) or install it with `pip`:

`pip install pyvibdmc`

It includes ways to use importance sampling, fixed-node dmc, adiabatic dmc, and more. It also has a suite of helper classes that you can use to easily parallelize potential energy evaluations, analyze wave functions obtained through DMC, and a plotter class to plot projections of the wave function onto coordinates of interest. If you have any questions, please ask.
