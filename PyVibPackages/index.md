In the McCoy Group, _most_ of us work primarily with our own home-built code. 
But we recently had two group members (Dr. Ryan Dirisio and Dr. Mark Boyer), who wrote up big python packages for Diffusion Monte Carlo (PyVibDMC) and nth-order Vibrational Perturbation Theory (PyVibPTn). 
Now, we still believe the best way to learn a new method is to code it yourself, these two packages are filled with _tricky tricks_ and lots of handlers to make the code run faster, reliably, and hopefully bug-free.
Although there is always room for user error...
