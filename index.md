# Where am I?

This is a site for documentation and references pages that have accumulated over the research projects that the 
McCoy Group has done. All code is presented as is with no promise that it will compile, run, work, be correct, or not
destroy your computer in a freak hurricane. Basically, use at your own risk.

### [References](References)

References written up to help explain topics that are common to our research. Usually aimed at a first-year graduate student
kind of audience. Often these are written by first years in the group as an introductions to Markdown and to explaining 
scientific concepts via code. There is useful information them by they should not be treated as gospel.

### [Documentation](Documentation)

Documentation for some of the python projects that we work on, which is autogenerated from the docstrings provided.
These docs are only as complete as the docstrings they come from, so essentially they're woefully incomplete. 
On the other hand, when combined with the unit tests provided [here](https://github.com/McCoyGroup/References) 
they can be a powerful tool for figuring out how to use the code.
